# Admissions Overrides

Admissions-specific shadow-DOM injections, class overrides, and utility classes that aren't general enough to live in `page-builder/OVERRIDES.md` or `page-builder/styles/critical.css`.

## Admissions logo width override

`umd-element-navigation-header` shadow CSS hard-codes `.element-header-logo img { max-width: 240px }` at tablet+. The admissions wordmark is wider than the default UMD primary wordmark, so we shadow-inject `max-width: 320px`.

Source: `pages/admissions.html` and `pages/academics.html` end-of-body scripts.

## Quote + brand chevron overlap

Custom `.quote-with-chevron` / `.chevron-overlap` layout used on the admissions homepage between the dark About UMD section and the overlay-card bank. Not generalizable yet — admissions-only for now.

## Deadlines table

`.deadlines-table` — simple two-column rich-text table for the Important Dates section. Admissions-specific.
